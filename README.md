This code implements the word segmentation algorithm proposed in the following paper.

Deng Cai and Hai Zhao, Neural Word Segmentation Learing for Chinese. ACL 2016.

Lastest updateÔºÅ We improved the system, the coressponding paper is going to appear at ACL2017, with source code at [this repo](https://github.com/jcyk/greedyCWS)

Update! a faster implementation using dynet as backend is now available.
```python train.py -d``` to use the new (dynet based) version.

## Usage (theano, also helpful to dynet version):
### - train
```python train.py -t```. To train a model, first check the hyperparameter settings in *train.py*. The training procedure will result a *config* file at the very beginning in which your hyperparameter settings are preserved, and output the trained model parameters to **\.npz* per epoch. 

### - test 
```python test.py params.npz input_file output_path config_file```. To test a trained model, specify the file that stores the model parameters as *params.npz* as well as the corresponding configuration file *config_file*. The test procedure will read data from *input_file* and output result to *output_path*.

### - evaluate     
For example, To see the best result (F1-score 95.5) on PKU dataset reported in our paper, first generate the output file through the trained model ( ```python test.py best_pku.npz ../data/pku_test somepath best_pku_config```), then use the command ```./score ../data/dic ../data/pku_test somepath```.
